-- QUESTION
-- In this set of exercises, we will work with a billing database for a company that provides web hosting services to its customers. The database will contain information about its customers and the services each customer uses. Each customer can have any number of services, and every service can have any number of customers. Thus, there will be a many-to-many (M:M) relationship between the customers and the services. Some customers don't presently have any services, and not every service must be in use by any customers.

-- ANSWER

CREATE TABLE customers (
  PRIMARY KEY (id),
  id SERIAL,
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  payment_token CHAR(8) UNIQUE,
    CHECK (payment_token ~ '^[A-Z]{8}$')
);

CREATE TABLE services (
  PRIMARY KEY (id),
  id SERIAL,
  description TEXT NOT NULL,
  price NUMERIC(10,2) NOT NULL,
    CHECK (price >= 0.00)
);

CREATE TABLE customers_services (
  PRIMARY KEY (id),
  id SERIAL,
  customer_id INTEGER REFERENCES customers (id) ON DELETE CASCADE NOT NULL,
  service_id INTEGER REFERENCES services (id) NOT NULL,
  UNIQUE(customer_id, service_id)
);
